Looks awesome.
Battery was 49% when I switched on..and after 2 hours of continuous use it is 42% now.
Camera is awesome.
Sound is loud.
Display is amazing.
Mine is Opal black one.
Pros:
1.Looks stunning high end category.
2.Battery is also powerful.
3. Fast charging.
Cons:
1.Camera is not upto mark as it says 48MP it's like 8 Mp
2. Storage & Memory statistics are confusing. Showing 900 mb free though I am not accessing much resources.
3. Earphone slot given at down side which makes difficult to handle phone.

awesome phone
 Bestest phone...
Good battery life
Amazing camera
Fast processing
 I am adding video of unboxing this mobile. A only amazon is selling this mobile in great indian sale.
Best part of this mobile is you ar not able to get any cheaper that this mobile for this configuration.
Only one thing which I don't like in this mobile is it's little heavier than other Samsung mobile and also size is little big which is not user friendly.
45 MP camera is not upto the mark its looks like 16 mp focus.Else phone is ok
Phone is getting heat up.
Phone rear camera quality is very poor.
Speaker is also not good compare to its price.
Phone body is not good.
very fast delivery by amazon..excellent phone....value for money at this price
Nice product. the phone is not bulky even it contain 600 mah massive battery. this is the main plus point in this price point. the second advantage is the processor. Samsung has used the most advanced processor i this price range which can handle multiple complex situations except heavy games.
One of the best Display Ever. One of the best Battery Ever. One of the Supperb Camera is Ever. Processor is Mindblowing.
sAMOLED is Worth it. Exynose 9611 is Worth it. 6000mAh battery is worth it. 48MP Camera  is Worth it.
ONE OF THE BEST BUDGET SAMSUNG MOBILE EVER.
nice battery and camera
Product is very poor
Camera is the worst
Display is poor
Hitting issue
Hitting like blasting
So carefully buy at youre own risk
Mst phone hain
"Well, this is another classic example like how our much hyped cinemas/movie do (Flop). I really thought Samsung is doing something to get back in the mid segment market with a quality product, but doesn't look like it. The only positive in this mobile is the battery, but it's too early to comment on it. Camera is not upto the mark, no gorila glass protection and more importantly this has sim detection issue especially Vodafone and idea. Bought this mobile but unable to use it. I would recommend Redmi phones over Samsung."
"Very good product at an affordable price , for Students it is a MUST, if you don't use your phone heavily consider going for Samsung Galaxy M10s It's almost the same features lesser price, but those who wants to push the limits just go for this phone 200% worth the price."
"Use tempered glass and back cover for protection, as the phone doesn't come with Gorilla glass 5 protection and sAMOLED screens are very delicate and costly."
"Very much satisfied, thank you amazon."
Thanks for reading ; )
"Camera quality is very bad. Blur in all photos. When zooming any pic, it cracks. If compared to redmi 7 pro camera, redmi is much better"
Product is found damaged. Phone not getting Boot / Start.
Need replacement
"I received my Samsung m30s , this phone is looking nice , camera quality is good , but amazon packing is poor"
This is good mobile battery 2 day working and camera is good wide angled so much good
"Wonderful phone at such a reasonable price . The only drawback is that there aare no earphones with the phone , otherwise the phone is great, with wonderful speed to start with  lovely display"
Phone is reasonably good at the price 12699rs. display quality is very good. Black color is decent with little green mixed in the corner. Phone could have been little handy in size apart from that back side panel is little cheaper in terms of touch nd feel. But can't blame it bcz of its price point.
Good
Battery backup highlight
Camera also super
My suggestion for this price very good option
"Bought it for camera, 48+8+5 is just on paper, picture quality is just 5 MP, even a 2500 phone clicks better than this...front camera is super pathetic, it's 2mp."
Don't buy this item guys. Go for other options.
It's a worst choice. Wastage of money.
PROs-
"Just one Pro ie 6000 mAh battery, but for that Battery backup You will not throw away Your hard earn 14000 rupees."
CONs-
"1) CAMERA quality is big draw back. In 14k You will get Redmi Note 7pro, RealMe X,Xt with better camera quality than this."
2) Panel is of low quality plastic which is giving crackling sound. Which is annoying and worrisome.
"3) Super Amoled screen is just a myth, no brightness adjustment, hence more battery consumption."
4) One UI is pathetic. Not for old people in the house.
"5) The promises made by Samsung is not up to the mark, and it is not acceptable by a BRAND like Samsung."
"6) With this type of build quality, Camera and display, price should be at 8999 maximum."
HIGHLY DISAPPOINTED.
"PLEASE, DON'T BUY this phone, otherwise You will regret later."
Writing this review after using for a Week.
"The camera quality  is disgusting,  and It doesn't fit the description of 48mp."
"Even when there are no apps running, I am getting only 2.8GB usable ram."
"When I am asking for a phone replacement for defective piece, associates deny it by stating that we don't have any proof for product being defective."
I am a prime member since a long time and this is how they treat their old customers.
"My Idea Sim cards are not working in both the slots. I am receiving notification as ""mm Sim not Allowed"". I contacted for product return but they are not accepting my return. I am totally frustrated now."
Good
It is really a monster.  Looks are awesome battery is amazing 6000mah . It's super slow motion feature is reallly amazing .Totally worthy every single penny. I am buying it in 11500 ..
Over all reviews
Camera 5/5
Performances 5/5
Display 5/5
Battery 5/5
New mobile phone received
But not received eyear phone LEED
M30s today 30/92019
"First of all I would like to mention the battery life of SAMSUNG GALAXY M30s , it's superb no need of power bank you can use it for one and half day when fully charged . And the SUPER AMOLED display is awesome. The most important thing is the CAMERA quality 48 MP is also superb as it's giving an equal performance when compared to DSLR cameras . Everything in M30s are superb. Mobile is very comfortable while holding, the curves are really nice that's helping to feel comfortable. Over all it's a very nice mobile. And thanks amazon for ""GREAT INDIAN SALE""."
SUPERB MOBILE.
Build quality is pathetic
Cell reception is bad
Battery drains like hell
Totally regrettable purchace
I bought the Samsung M30s on 28th Sept. But I am highly disappointed with this phone due to the following reasons:
1. Camera quality is pathetic ( i don't think it's 48 MP)
2. The phone didn't read my sim...(i used multiple Sims)
Excellent
"a very good smartphone for millennials having monster battery, superior big screen and fast exynos processor."
the phone has a slippery backcase.
overall a great smartphone at budget price.
Fantastic phone ever...
Received a defective handset with scratches on the bezel.
Amazon selling LIE ...mobile heated during call and charging the phone..camera quality is very bad..please don't buy this mobile
Never expected this kinda inferior product from the Big brand like Samsung.
"Received M30s today and really  a great buy . Picture quality is too good . Can update more a week later on the perfomance. Dolby Atmos really rocks . Body build is better than usual SAMSUNG mobile. Perfomance is fine in my 6GB ram variant . Battery backup seems fine , hardly 5% is utilized for normal usage with 24×7 location,4G/ wifi and limited calls ."
Phone look 4/5
Sound(very good sound quality) 5/5
Over all superb phone.
Good Product and amazing fast delivery by Amazon within 2 hour only
Cameras  Quality not good both Front and Back. Screen Quality also not good.
"I do not received Samsung m30s phone with phone back cover, flip cover and screen gtad cover... Please deliver my phone cover and screen cover..."
Here are pros and cons
Pros:-
1. Screen (at 11.6K price)
2. Battery (6K mAh though will perform like 4K mAh due to software issue I guess coz hardware has 6K capacity)
 Cons :-
1. Camera Sucks
2. Performance Choppy even in normal uses not talking about gaming
3. GPU Sucks very slow performance in the gaming
4. Heating issues while playing games
Wouldn't recommend any one to buy this phone
Ultimate Product..
At this budget with good features a nice phone
Body material is very worst
"Camera quality Disappointed front camera,  not clear images 16 mp like 8 mp, phone  heavy waite hand on , not purchase camera lovers"
"Extremely bad network strength..Camera quality is not so good as it claims 48MP.  Also, mobile is heating up after few minutes of call. Disappointed from Samsung."
Awesome phone... thanks Amazon for fast delivery..
Camera ok
Processor wow
Ui good
Battery good
Having sme call quality signal issues with airtel.. volte signals r not stable as compared to other phones.. hope samsung solve this issue in further updates
It's a scame I am facing problem since day 1 I am facing battery problem and when I tried to contact Amazon and tried to replace product they said that will tell technicians to check your phone and then my phone's replace date is 10th Oct and I am complaining everyday and still they are not replying me and telling me that we will solve it not date is gone and I am trying to call them they are not even picking up the call ....... I will not buy anything form Amazon I hate this ... Amazon sucks...
"Not impressed with the camera. I don't find the ""48 mp"" camera to be any good."
5 stars for delivery as I got it within 24 hours of placing order. Working awesome and smooth! I will update this review after 15 days of usage.
The battery finally stood for 4 day for my limited use specified above. Overall perfomance is good and acceptable.
Front Camera should be little better remaining all features are EXCELLENT!!!
More than my expectations!!!

"8. It's ""The best deal"" in this price segment."

SD card sometimes  un mounting  automatically.. we have to restart the phone to bring contents  in sd card
First impressions...
*1-week update added.
"For now, I can only compare the M30s with the Asus Zenfone 5z and a OnePlus 3T, both of which 'were' flagships of the respective brands. In the past I have used Motorolas exclusively. I 'was' a big Motorola fan and consider stock android as the best user experience on a smartphone."
Pros
"1. Display 5/5 – Big, Beautiful but more importantly a well-calibrated one. It's easily better than the Oppo and Vivo AMOLED implementations, simply because Samsung has taken the pains to somehow calibrate each unit."
"2. Ergonomics 5/5 – You are unlikely to call this device bulky or cumbersome for one-handed use because of the 20:9 aspect ratio, excellent weight management and OneUI optimisations for one-handed use."
"3. Battery Life 4/5 – 11-12hrs SoT for me i.e. 1.5days use. Frankly, it's a bit disappointing considering that my older Motorolas gave 6-8hrs on 13nm architecture SoCs, had 2,700-3,000 mah batteries and had less efficient LCD panels. At 6,000mah it should've given close to 14hr SoT, for my use-case."
"4. Performance 5/5 – Very fast app opening speeds! Compares very well with the Snapdragon 821 powered and phenomenally well optimized OnePlus 3T. Falls short of the Asus 5z, which is a no-brainer. RAM management is decent too, of the 4GB RAM I tend to have 1.5GB free. 8-10 non-game apps are typically always in memory. UFS 2.1 is a Big leap for those of us upgrading from eMMC storage. This is particularly noticeable in both app opening speeds as well as in the gallery app where Images and Video thumbnails load instantly. Deleting is also super fast!"
"5. Touch Response 5/5 – Fast, precise, with low latency. Particularly noticeable on the keyboard, quick toggle menu, as well as when knocking off notifications or deleting feeds on say, the Chrome browser. Faster animations further this experience."
"6. One UI 3.5/5 – It's difficult to rate it because I've ALWAYS used stock android. And although I enjoy the add-ons OneUI comes with I also miss the clean, fluid, conflict-free experience that stock android is known for. Mind you, this is FAR better than the Chinese ROMs that I tried out in offline stores; ColorOS, FuntouchOS, MIUI and even ZenUI. OneUI is less obtrusive, cleaner, has no ads and is easier to use one-handed. OneUI isn't flawless, I have experienced app crashes (Tata Sky and Palabre) on when I never faced any issues with them with my previous phones. It does ship with bloatware, asks for a LOT of permissions, has unrequired 'suggestions'. Though all of that can be shut down within 5mins. What you do have to put up with is – stutters. You see them from time to time. It may not be a deal breaker, but yes  it's clearly a step-down from stock android. For me, if Stock android is 100... Oxygen OS gets a 100 too, One UI gets 85 and ZenUI gets 75. The other Chinese skins (MIUI, ColorOS, FuntouchOS) are definitely far more heavily modified and further away from the core experience android is known for."
"7. Call Quality and Cellular Reception 5/5 – I actually placed calls from all the weak spots at home where signals drop to just 1 bar. Thankfully the M30s doesn't drop signals more than other phones that I've used in fact it's a shade better than the Motorolas I had previously. It's not a mind-blowing signal-catcher either, but yes I do get internet on my Jio sim where sometimes the other phones would struggle. Call quality was Good too, slightly better than the 5z but just short of the OnePlus 3T. Compared to 5z, the sound is sharper (but never sibilant) as opposed to being slightly more muffled and recessed in the upper frequencies."
8. Reliability/Peace of mind and a vast Service network.
Cons
"1. Build quality 3/5 – Its a unibody plastic build but a rather flimsy grade of plastic has been used. You can feel and at times also hear the plastic flex next to the power button and the fingerprint scanner. The button themselves have a short travel and satisfactory tactility. Most Chinese phones (which I checked out at offline stores) offer a better build and have Gorilla Glass too, which is rated higher than Schott or Asahi's dragontail (used here), especially in terms of drop protection. For scratch resistance this should be ok, hopefully."
"2. Charging performance 2/5 – 2hrs 30mins is very 2015 (6,000 mah, I know). Perhaps an 18w charger helps shave off 15mins or so?, I'll give an update on that. What's more irksome is that if you are using the phone while charging it significantly slows down charging speed (3.5hrs or so!), this is a difference you can't miss. It does not happen on the other devices I have at home, to this extent."
"Excellent features, there is no con at all... i am enjoying all the way.. flagship mobile features with low budget price... go for it."
Product was good.Value for money but one thing I don't like is Samsung have not provided 15/18W charger in the box.Battery performance was superb
You can easily differ the pictures taken using wide angle camera
no ear phone
touch not proper
slow speed
not good quality
Awesome Battery life
Display battery ok but  camera not good
Disine super light weight
Review of Samsung M30s (4GB variant ):
"I am pretty much sure that many people might have already purchased this device during Amazon festive season like me, later thought of writing review or rating or Checking what others purchaser thinks about this device, or if you are a person who is looking to purchase this device after Amazon festival season or after seeing this review then you have done a good job (even though you might have lost some perks, if any), So, that I can let you know certain things which people obviously miss out in seeing YouTube review videos."
"I hope you have time to read my review, So let me confirm to the scope of this review; I am not going speak about camera, display and other common stuffs, as many YouTubers have done good job in those areas and you can check out any video in the YouTube either English or Hindi or regional language of yours, they seems to be good. I personally gone through most of them they are all seems to speak in same aspect,  so, if you consider my suggestion you can check any one of them to know basic info, out of those videos; I thought most informative was Geekranjit and C4tech unboxing video."
"Let’s start out Pros and Cons which you may feel informative, I am writing this after using this device exhaustively for 2 days;"
Pros;
"1. I was afraid to buy Samsung device for the reason that, it comes with bloatware (Think as Useless apps). Thanks to Samsung One UI which has less apps and you can uninstall most of the apps including some of google apps which you don’t use. But be care full while setting up device; ensure you uncheck all unnecessary permission to avoid ads and bloatware. But funny thing is you can’t uninstall Netflix and Facebook, though you can disable them. (Approx. you will be having 12 to 15apps which you can’t disable or uninstall)"
2. Out of 4 GB ram you get 1.7 GB ram free and out of 64GB rom you get ~53GB (approx.) free out of box.
3. Samsung one UI is good in ram management (that helps apps running in background and ease access all time you need)
"4. If you enable developer option you can see much customization, like;"
• Reducing animation (Helps in speeding up device)
• Auto Night mode( which seems to be not working right now but after future updates bug will be fixed)
• Limiting the background process
"• Under battery management option you can even set sleeping mode for desired apps.(For instance; I don’t want to see ads from true caller, I use it only to search unknown numbers therefore I put this app under sleep mode so it automatically force stop the app once I am done with my job so that It can’t send me notification)"
5. Battery management seems to be good and there is emergency mode to save your battery from draining.
"6. With respect to chipset it comes equipped with Exynos 9611 utilizes 10nm processor (Think like lesser nm means better speed and good performance, for instance Oneplus 7 pro utilizes 7nm so it is superfast). I personally compared this chip-set with snapdragon 712 (Used in Realme XT, Realme 5pro, other competitive devices) as per official website spec of these both seems to be same there is no exceptional differences, however as per some website they claim exynos 9611 is better than snapdragon 712 and other claims vice versa(Opposite). I do checked gaming review of both chip-set, both seems to be performing at par, worth to note again that Samsung one UI is boosting a lot this chipset for best performance. However, heating and lag was observed with the same chipset used in Samsung A50s while playing PUBG in high graphics. However, many gamer while playing PUBG on this device has suggested it’s good. (Check out gaming review of Gizmoddict for Samsung A50s {since same chipset} in YouTube for more information)"
Cons:
1. Phone warms up little bit while doing multitasking you will be able feel near rare camera. (depends on app you use)
"2. Durability seems to be very bad you need to be much careful with this device, I am not going take any chance in it but still you can check out Gupta information system video with respect to durability test of Samsung m30s in YouTube."
3. For some strange reason my songs which are in ogg format are not recognized as songs by music player in this device so I converted my entire song list to mp3 using some third party app.
"4. Auto brightness seems to be not adjusting automatically, I don’t know whether it is a bug or due to screen guard and I think in case of bug future updates may fix this bugs."
"5. In Samsung official page under support tab, I noticed this model will receive quarterly security updates, which is worth noting."
"6. Before making purchase of this device I noticed in some newspaper (I think Indian express) that  this device will receive Android Q update and Samsung is planning to give much support for this new M series device ( Don’t laugh because I noted in con section, since it just reported not guaranteed)"
"(If you have any doubts about this device or need specific info you can comment or ask in Q&A section I would love to help you out, if I know)"
good
Delivered within two days
Looking awesome
"3. Cameras 2/5 – I've used SLRs/DSLRs for over 2 decades so I understand a thing or two. Which also means I don't expect phones, especially at this price point to do great. Even with toned down expectations the cameras are rather poor. The '48mp' Detail is absent, dynamic range mediocre and there's over sharpening/ringing too, though colours are thankfully more natural than I expected from Samsung. Frankly, the '48mp', '64mp', '108mp' number dropping these days is wayyy deep into gimmicky territory because these things at best may be a tad better than older 12/16mp modules, when implemented right. I can only say that it's nowhere near the 12mp primary camera on the Asus 5z (especially with gCam, at night). What's good is the Video Stability & super slow motion feature. Stabilization is actually better than the other two, especially surprising if you know that both 5z & 3t have OIS, this does not! I will update this section if/when I can compare it against its class."
"4. LTE speeds over Jio 2.5/5 – A bit disappointing actually. Here it's more like the 6-series from 2018. Even with UFS 2.1, app downloading over Jio was very similar to the older phones I've used. Nowhere close to the 3t, leave alone 5z. Mind you, the Snapdragon 7-series is FAR closer to the 835/845 on this category."
"5. Heapdhone quality 3/5 – I'm not a hardcore audiophile but I've spent a small fortune on audio over the years. The m30s has a lively presentation with good dynamics and respectable detail but the frequency response isn't flat. The bass is clearly boosted and the upper frequencies are muted. Its definitely a flavoured sound unlike my Moto G5 Plus which had phenomenally clean audio and superb stereo separation (price no bar!), with my Audio Technica ath-m50, Soundmagic e10c and Beyerdynamic Byron I never had a complaint. The M30s has better detail for sure but it's a more central ('in your head'), less neutral sound. The Hidizs Sonata HD is a good option if you want a solid upgrade for around 2-2.5k, if you want to go cheaper still try the pixel Type-C to 3.5mm dongle there's a lot of praise for it and it's available for just 1.3k or so."
6. Lack of XDA love – The XDA community showers tons of love to Snapdragon powered phones in making them cleaner/slicker/customizable with Custom ROMs because Exynos is locked out by Samsung :(
"7. Speaker performance – Not bad but certainly nothing above mediocre. At least it's not that ear piercing, shrill sound that some models at this price point are plagued with and its loud too. OnePlus 3T has a significantly cleaner, tighter output. I won't even bother drawing a comparison with the 5z ;)"
"8. Android Update track record – I found that Samsung has one of the slowest update speeds, 6-10 months after official release (if you're lucky!). Which probably means no Android 10 until March 2020 :( May be things change in the OneUI era?"
"First impressions, a full 5/5."
I'll update with Long-term findings.
"--- 7th October, 2019. 1-week update ---"
One UI experience.
"So I've begun to appreciate OneUI in its entirety. The stutters have reduced, I guess when the phone was new there was a lot happening in the background. Besides, some of the intrusive stuff was still running which I've since force stopped and disabled."
The features that I think are great additions over stock android...
1. Open in pop-up view – True multitasking! A huge plus in my book.
"2. Always on display – A great feature to have on an AMOLED display and a 6,000mah battery."
3. The screenshot toolbar – it's well designed and the added functionality is much appreciated.
4. Gesture based quick app switcher – A neat and well implemented way of quickly moving through apps
"5. 9-band Equaliser – The presets and the fully customizable graphic equaliser have system wide effect over audio, a very underrated feature."
"6. Dark/Night mode – Android 10 will bring this at the system level. But it doesn't hurt to have it at some level already, even if its only for the system apps."
What I think are half-baked or unrequired features...
1. Aggressive auto brightness – The ambient light sensor almost always chooses a brighter than required output.
2. Assistive touch – 2 pages to swipe through is a good idea but most of it is of absolutely no use! And there's no option to customise it either.
"3. Screenshot shortcuts – They've given 3 bad ways of doing it. And the award for the worst experience goes to... ""Palm swipe""! Not only is it inconsistent but also senselessly cumbersome. 3-finger swipe on my Motorola worked flawlessly and was faster too. I tried the Assistive touch but that always-on-screen button soon became an eyesore. So I ended up with the Power button + Volume down key :("
All my other 'first impressions' remain unchanged.
A piece of advice for prospective buyers:
"If the negative reviews confuse you, please understand this – The negative reviews are by people who have either..."
1. Bought the device for the wrong reasons.
"2. Or have unrealistic expectations from a device that was available under 12k, at launch."
3. Or have a genuine issue with a bad unit (a very small percentage).
4. Or are paid trolls!
Most of the negative reviews seem to fall in category 1. & 2.
The USPs of this device are...
"1. A Very Very good display – It's accurate, most cheap AMOLED sporting devices are not. Which is why you get unnatural skin tones and unrealistic greens/reds with some other mid-range phones (Mi A3, Realme XT, Vivo z1x etc.)"
2. One UI – A FAR cleaner alternative to Chinese skins/ROMs
Got delivered at 29 September 2019 9:45am
Looks Awesome
Great Camera
Will update soon after thorough use.
5 star for Best Delivery Service by Amazon India.
Update: Battery is not Good it's draining very even you're not using your phone.
Charging is also very slow.
Not worth in this price segment.
Realme 5pro is far better than this.
Amazon is always great compare to flipkart. Awesome service. Well Samsung M30s is no surprise is a lovely phone packed with all amazing features and monster battery back up. Looks good feels like magic
Disappointed...Pathetic camera focus.
Wifi connectivity range also sUcKs.
"However, display and battery life are good."
Detailed Review:
"Camera: The rear and front camera quality is great, night mode is good enough to capture good shots. Additional zoom-out features for both front and rear camera is nice to have."
"Battery: I am really happy with battery backup as it lasts up to approx 2 days. Yes, approx 48 hours with medium usage including WiFi and GPS."
"Design, Touch, Look & Feel is awesome and even though it has a 6000mAh battery, it feels light."
The face recognition is also quick to sense and unlock. The processing speed is good enough for heavy games without much heating effect.
Initially I was happy to get such a good hardware this price. But as soon as I inserted sim problem initiates. Very poor network reception however at the same time other mobiles with same network showed 50 percent better reception. And Amazon is refusing to consider this issue.
As far as display is concerned it is one of the best display available in the market. Rear camera is superb but a bit disappointment is selfie camera. Battery life is good.
Overall if you can afford to compromise with network or in your area if network problem is not there then you can go for this mobile worth at this price
Built quality is poor. Front camera is worst. Back camera doesn't look like 48megapixel. The product which I received has a back panel issue. Don't buy pearl white.
An awesome phone for the price paid. Got it delivered within few hours of placing the order. The M30s has a pretty interesting triple camera set up on the back and the selfie shooter too is decent but the main focus has always been on the 6000 mAh battery which hopefully will last 2 days.
"I got a 10% discount on my SBI credit card and in addition to that I received Rs 1,000 cashback as Amazon Pay. Hence it would cost somewhere around 12K which is pretty surprising. I am very much impressed with Samsung."
"P.S. I am testing the camera, battery life and other stuff and I should be able to update this section shortly."
"By the way, the Super AMOLED screen is GORGEOUS."
"Update: The battery life is really amazing on this phone. Even after playing heavy games for long and watching videos with heavy usage, the battery lasts 2 days."
The phone does get heated up little bit after during playing games like PubG & Asphalt 9.
The camera quality is completely different than what is shown on Amazon.
48MP camera clicks the picture clicked on 8MP camera.
Best phone with this budget. Best battery.
Battery is really monstrous
Camera is awesome and picture quality is also good
Sound is good
Display is amazing.
"mine is opal black and it look amazing ,"
user interface is better than all other phones.
"rear camera is good (all you need is good light and steady hand) in low light i would recommend of using flash (it takes more detail),"
front camera average in low lighting and good in natural light.
"you can play pubg on HD ultra smoothly, and hdr with constant 30+fps."
"the more interesting function is AR emojies (must try),"
& pubg works excellent after update.
Massive Battery is hard to drain completely.
Phone is heating too much within 10 to 15minutes of normal using. Camera quality is very poor. Shutter speed  also slow.
3. Excellent battery life – 11/12hrs of SoT!
4. Fast app opening speeds and RAM management
5. Reliability!
I ordered a case but it hasn't been delivered yet.
Despite that there's not one scratch on the display or the back!
You will be disappointed if you are buying this device particularly for...
1. Build quality
2. or Camera performance
3. or Charging speed
4. or Superfast updates
"5. or for making NFC payments (via Google pay or Samsung pay). Though not many outlets accept this in India, at least not in Tier 2 cities, as of 2019."
Also remember that all other alternatives will come with their own set of drawbacks too.
"Can't have it all, not in 2019 at least."
"Rating unchanged, fully satisfied ""for the price paid!"""
"Probably  the only con about this smartphone is its camera quality, specifically  that of the front camera. The selfies are strictly average, although you can make them work with some basic editing on Snapseed or Lightroom, but they lack detail. The images are soft. Also, there's no support for GCam out of the box, so that makes it worse. But you definitely can make them work, they aren't that bad."
"But other than that, this is a really great deal. I've heard people complaining  about creaking noises in the back panel, but personally, I haven't noticed any such thing. I even tried pressing the back panel hard to just see, but it seemed  pretty  solid to me. Apart from that, the battery is obviously  outstanding and so is the display. The UI is smooth and snappy as well, no lag noticed. However, I am not a gamer, so I don't know how would that turn out."
"Overall, I think if you can settle in the camera area a bit, it's a great deal, considering you also get Samsung's  excellent  after sales experience and support."
Poor camera and performance and I'm unable to return the product
Value for money for this Smartphone & Thank you AMAZON
Received today best buy at given price.
"Everyone knows pros like battery, screen etc etc but there are many cons to"
1. Ram available is around 1.5 GB which becomes 800mb without much use
"2. Wifi speed is less, I have 50mbps plan and my m30s showing 30mbps whereas  my moto z play showing 48mbps"
3. Record time for super slow motion video is 2-3 sec only
4. Camera quality is ok ok only
5. Phones support max 15watt charge only
"Getting restarted frequently,camera also not good"
Worst..heating problem
Camera is a big disappointment in this phone. All other specs are good. If anyone looking for a good camera phone for not buy this.
"Samsung being a big player, don't know why they play such cheap tricks by saying camera is 48MP on paper and fooling people by providing a low quality camera in actual."
This phone should have been priced under 10K. Not worth of 14K.
Received within 24hrs. As of now it is good..
Outside design will give very good feeling as you are holding flagship set..
No back cover and screen guard.
Data cable is very short.
That's it as of now.
Awesome Product I realy Like it...
Camera... Awesome
Battery..... Mind Blowing
Overall it's best mobile in this Price Segment.😊😊😊😊😊
Pros :
"1)display colors, stand beyond my note8."
2)smooth touch
3)light weight for 6000mah packed
4)wonderful camera. better than my note8
5) complete value for money.
"Cons: somewhat cheap built, no earphones included, even very thin sim ejection pin saw heavy cost cutting. but best for price point."
"overall, 9 out of 10, dont hesitate if thats ur budget buy asap."
Finishing and Look wise phone is fine. But as it advertised about battery and performances it's not up to the mark. Battery won't even stand for a day.
Hi writing review after 1day use.
1.Its start heating during charging
2.My idea sim not worked for near about 8 hour ...o was thinking it was network issue hit after going to idea gallery they checked my sim in another mobile it was working fine.
3.There is network issue or u can say not getting range for idea & airtel.
4Required lots of time to load page on both network idea & Jio
4.Front camera quality is very poor like 8 MP.
It's my second day I will write again further  2 day use of mobile.
Camera was not at all worthy of even 1000 rs
Else everything is unbelievable extraordinary
Camera disappointed me
I have ordered m30s 48 mega pixel.this is truly a wrong information from ur company.mobile camera quality is very poor..I request everyone those who read this review plz don purchase m30s.worst camera performance.
Very affordable at this price point
According to my one day use
Pros:
Camera 5*
Display 5*
Touchscreen 5*
Battery 5*
Charging speed 3*
Samsung one UI 4*
Exynos 9611 Processor 4* performance same as snapdragon 665
Gaming Experience 4*
Looking 4*
Cons:
Must have Corning gorilla glass 5 protection
Atleat a silicon back cover inside the Box
Very much slippery inhand feeling
Awasome phone by samsung..love it .I got got it in Rs. 11500/- for cash back  offers.1st look is amazing.. Hope that performance will be the best❤️❤️❤️ Absolutely Satisfied with this phone❤️❤️
Positive points:
1. The battery is humongous. it's 6000 Mah. It will last for at least 2 days for normal use. For extensive use like 12 hrs of video stream then it will last at least 24-30 hours.
2. It comes with a 15W type-c charger. It goes from 10 to 100 percent levels in about two hours.
3. It gets an upgrade in the form of the octa-core Exynos 9611 SoC whereas M30 uses Exynos 7809 SoC.
4. Exynos 9611 SoC comes with Mali-G72 MP3 graphics which are able to handle gaming relatively well.
5. It comes with Android 9.0 Pie which is layered with Samsung's own OneUI.
6. The camera can capture 4K videos too but without stabilization.
7. It has an impressive 6.4-inch Super AMOLED display with minimal bezels.
8. It has polycarbonate back which isn’t as premium as a glass-back construction but does seem solid.
9. The finger scanner is quick. It supports face unlock as well but it isn't fastest (Still does its job).
"10. With 4 GB ram, the performance is smooth. No issues so far."
11. It comes with a triple-slot i.e. dual sim option (4g+4g) and a memory card (You can expand up to 512 GB if need be).
12. Pixel density is 403 ppi and resolution is 1080 x 2340 pixels.
Cons:
Con's:
"1. The camera is just good on paper. The device lets you capture 48MP shots, but you wouldn’t notice a world of difference between regular 12MP images and this one. Absolute no details at all."
2. Night mode isn’t the best.
"3. Selfie shooter could’ve been better i.e. selfies are good, but they can’t compete with rivals"
4. No display protection (I mean screen guard here).
"5. It sports a single speaker at the bottom, the audio output on the Galaxy M30s is decent but not rich enough."
6. It doesn't come with earphones.
7. Some bloatware are preinstalled & you do get unnecessary notifications from the MyGalaxy. Why Samsung need this?
"I purchased this at Rs 12,600 during Amazon sale and in addition, I got 1-year screen damage protection as well. I am fine with this phone at this price point."
"Product is good and fast charging  is also good, but slippery and phone is little bit heat during first update. Camera, voice quality and speaker are all good. And battery is good, played pubg under high graphics for 1 hour and only 5% was reduced..."
Not much difference in build over Samsung Galaxy M30 except for back color. Screen looks brighter compared to M30 and most of the other mobiles in this price range.
Even the processing speed has improved I felt. There was no lag even after opening 8 applications. Not many unnecessary apps like in other android mobiles.
Battery:
USP to sell this mobile
One heck of a beast. Used for entire night and battery dropped by only 9% which is great
Did not observe any heating issues (though it's quite early to judge)
Camera:
"Like almost any mobile, works really well in good light"
"Sometimes you get a doubt if it's really 48MP, otherwise pictures are good"
New functions specially slow motion and super slow motion are cherry on the cake
Overall verdict:
Worth buying specially if you're someone who is on mobile all the time. Buy it before the price increases.
"Update- the USP of this phone is battery, but I see that it started to drain really quick."
Disappointed.
Device is not working
Showing error - Sim card not allowed.
Awesome price
nice phone back cover mis
Not worth...processor is very slow. Would not recommend to buy to any one
Good mobile but back side quality is not good it's plastic and sound of this mobile is low no gorilla glass protection only two things are good 48mp camera and 6000 mah battery
"I noticed a serious problem as soon as I took the device first in my hand. It feels like the body of this device from the sides(especially from the heights) is loose or something and it makes some creepy sounds when I hold my device firmly as if the back cover fitting is not proper with the body. It also feels like there is a hidden button on the sides as I get ""Tap"" sound on holding the device."
very dispointed with camera..its not like 48 mp..front camera  is also very poor as compared my Y1 front camera (16mp).. prefered it only because of its 48 mp camera and brand name SAMSUNG..but huge disppointment..
The camera is awful. It's not 48 mp it's  16 mp. The back is plastic and gets heated easily. I bought this after checking the reviews but honestly it's not worth the price. It's only good on advertisements not in actual.
Pros
Excellent Battery
Good Camera
Fantastic Display
Decent Sound
Touch I'd works fast
Fast Charging
Type C charging
Cons
No Samsung Pay
No Samsung Pay mini
No headphone in the box
No back case in the box
Heating issue
Simply go for it...
Amazon Customer Care. Samsung M30 Go Monster is really sleek & good. Battery life is extended upto 6000mAh. Which is correct.
What is missing a detailed user manual which one needs to down load from the net. The other missing item is head phone &mic since it is purchased online. Has three cameras. One for selfie and two rear cameras. Battery is very powerful 6000maH. Long duration. No need to charge frequently. Once charged to fully or 100/. It lasts for more than 2 full days.
How to migrate data from old smart phones Samsung J2 & J7 Nxt is missing in future if Samsung provides guidelines will be useful. N. Srinivasan
"Amezing product by samsung. Samsung did briliant by removing hybrid slot and making dedicated slot for 2 sims and 1 micro sd card. Thanks to amazon for delivering it in less than 16 hours. After unboxing, first look and 2 hours of usage, extremely satisfied. Triple camera with 48 mega pixel is just icing on cake."
 By far the Best Smartphone in this price  range..
Great Camera
Smooth UI
Amazing Screen.
Battery  backup too good..
"Camera quality is not at all upto the mark, both the front and back. don't buy it if you interested more in camera. 16 mp AI front camera picking poor quality picture. Back camera is better"
Awesome battery - 2 Days
Fast charging 15% charged in 30 mins
"Camera 48MP, ( quality may not be superb ), let see quality."
Camera modes are less.
Perfomance & processor is good.
No screen finger lock
Face lock is there.
"If you gently press the back of the device against its screen along its perimeter, you can easily see the back, filling the gap in between."
Amazon has scheduled an inspection visit for it at my place in the coming days. I hope that the technician will understand the issue and I will get a replacement for it asap.
"Note: Not only me, but many people are facing the same issue."
"Purchased it for effective price of ₹11,500."
Battery and sAMOLED screen are deciding factors for this purchase. Samsung OneUI is smooth.
It is not fast charging as mentioned.the camera is okay .grains are visible in pictures taken.pics in night mode do not have clarity.
The photos taken in adequate light are good..
The usp is its battery ...after using it extensively also it gives a good 1.5 day run on a full charge.
Thanx to amazon for 1 day delivery
But The upper half of the phone is heating too much.
Its constantly heating up.
"Bought on 29th Sept. From day 1 network issue remain try to call several times to Amazon they give such nonsense option for bad network, try to reach seller to buy email can't be reach, I had two phone from RealNetworks and Asus on that both my 4g sims working with full network but with my Samsung m30s it's just show one signal bar...I don't have any hope that amazon or either seller can do this respect whatsoever, I am writing only be to aware that your m30s can give you such kind of trouble."
"And please zero star rating for this treatment, but that I can't do, first time given to amazon so sad and utterly disappointed."
Camera quality very poor as mentioned 48 MP.
Ordered it as soon as the sale started yesterday and received it today itself. Overall looks a great phone. Will be updating review after using it a bit
While ordering the phone I thought that it would be good even after viewing some of the negative reviews specially about cameras but the phone disappointed me also in more aspects.
"First, more than 30% battery drains out within 5 hours without doing any heavy task just upgrading apps and device."
"Second,  processor is not up to mark. I played dancing lines and it suffered while running. Earlier I had redmi note 5 pro which ran the game very smoothly."
"Third, as in most of the reviews camera quality is not good as specified."
It is first time I made a very bad choice. The specifications are only in papers not in real
life.
Good battery ...vry good display
I received on 2 Oct in time thanks to Amazon.
Super  fantastic  smartphone.
Great camera.
Batty backup ....extraordinary.
Finger print scanner  super...
In gaming experience no lags..
Totly .....
Super duper phone.....
VALUE FOR MONEY....$$$$
Excellent mobile for low cost and advanced features like display quality and great  sound system Dolby atoms. I like very much. Camera quality is also extremely high with this range.  The UI and all the new enhancing animations and icons extremely looking awesome. I can  give  5 out of 5
Totally waste of money wrost product. Next time I'm never buy on amazon.
Feeling awesome. Big battery and camera. Feel as a monster with device. Amazon delivered quickly and thank you give the early access to prime members.
It is a treat to finally have a phone which is value for money from the house of Samsung. I have used this phone for 3 days as my primary and want to share the following Pros and Cons.
Pros-
"1.Excellent set of cameras, 48 megapixel mode is great but the normal 12 mp mode is great too. The wide angle lens is the widest available in the market at this price point."
"2.Battery life is exemplary, with moderate usage, a full charge lasts close to 2 days."
3.Processor speed is excellent but not the best in class though. Yet in day to day usage one wouldn't find any problems.
4.Type C port and a 15 watt fast charger provided in the box is a huge plus.
5.Has a triple slot solution allowing for a dedicated micro sd slot with 2 sim slots.
"6.The display is to die for. Gorgeous, that is the only word for it, Samsung SUPER AMOLED FHD+."
Cons-
1. Built quality is a downside having a poly carbonate back and no gorilla glass protection. (It has a version of Dragon tail glass though ). Please use a case.
"2. For the cameras, the wide angle camera can record videos but Samsung's new implementation Super Steady Mode doesn't work on the wide angle camera. Also, with the super steady mode on, the video quality drops while recording even through the main rear camera. It will be excellent if Samsung can fix this via an OTA upgrade."
"3. This point is entirely personal, I did not like the color gradation in this one, the vertical one. Rather would have preferred a mono color back."
Small size in width
Length is  good
I purchased the mobile on 28th September.
I think Samsung  finally listen to their customers and brought very competetive mobile in its class.
 I have been using the mobile (4GB 64GB) for almost 10 days now. Here are the things i observed
"One UI seems lighter and simpler than other UIs like Mi UI, colorOS , I observed no lags so far, i really like one UI."
Good things:
".Super Amoled screen, colors are punchy, viewing angles are great 5/5."
".Back camera 48MP, takes really good pictures,  turn on scene optimizer for even better pictures 4.5/5."
".One UI, simple,  light and fast 5/5."
".Battery, it is huge and Samsung sw optimization make it even better, i am getting SOT of 9hrs to 10hrs 5/5."
".Form factor,  it is great in hand and didn't feel heavy 5/5."
.Sound quality(Dolby atmos) via headphones 5/5.
Not so good things:
".Build quality, it is average, i can hear tiny sound when i touch side of the phone 3/5."
.Front 16Mp camera is very average and takes soft pics like 8mp 3/5.
".Signal reception is also average, you will get 1 bar less signal compared to other phones in competition 3/5."
".Back wide angle camera 8MP, taking images when fish eye effect, hope it can be fixed, 3.5/5."
Techy and gaming things:
".Gaming: i m not a hard core gamer, pubg and wwc2 ran fine better than redmi note 7 pro 4.5/5"
".GCAM: camera2api support is limited only, the current gcam ports are not fully working,  hope Samsung enables it, to make us tinker around with gcam ports in future 4/5"
My opinion:
It's a perfect gift for beloved one.
I was too much excited to unbox Samsung M30s on day 1 release.
"Yesterday I purchased this phone mainly because of massive battery (6000 mH) and to get stock android experience. For the last 5 years, I was using redmi phone (all in my house).  Then I thought to change to another; shortlisted realme and samsung.  After one day (14 hours ) use, I found the phone is HEATING HEATING HEATING so much and battery dropped from 100 to 78 after recording video for say 45 minutes. ( I was expecting 2 days battery). If I am cool and keep the phone without any job, it remains cool.  Out  of 64 GB,17.4 gb is used by system/user data (user data is only 270 MB), 2.7GB is used for application. When no application is running in front/back, 2.3GB memory is used up.  Then what is stock android - all memory and storage is swallowed up.  If you select vibration, no ringtone (either one ). Not possible to set vibration for touch effect.  No vibration is possible on call connect. Very difficult to take  screen shot(still could not).  The screen and phone is slippery. Touch response is bad (I may adapt to) . Finger scanner is not much responsive ( I may adapt).  I am little disappointed because of my expectations. Still I will keep the phone hoping for some method I would find out for the problems."
Awesome phone at such a low price
"If you watch lot of online content like YouTube, Amazon prime etc., and doesn't bother about issues i mentioned above, go for it."
Camera quality is very poor considering 48+8+5 Rear and 16 front compared to other smartphones
"Lack of some basic and advanced features,such as doesnt show connection speed,lack of shortcuts for screenshots and back buttons,doesnt display any colored light while arriving notification,earphone slot at the bottom,etc."
Pros:
Stellar battery life
AMOLED display
Lightweight design
Competitive cameras
Cons:
Lacks premium finish
15W fast charging is little slow
Low light camera performance still feels lacking
Although for the price this phone is a monster!
"Also note that this phone has Android Pie 9.0 out of the box, and i received a software update just after setting up my phone."
"Very bad experience, touchscreen inactive"
Touch is bad too sensitive
Camera not good at all battery is 6000 but will last for 1 day only
Better buy realme or oppo bad means bad
Garbage seriously disappointed
Best in market in this price range
Worst camera👎
One of the worst picture quality. Sound quality is horrible. Don’t get trapped.
Worst phone....very slow and touch is very bad...
Screen quality is very poor...doesn't look sAmoled. Completely lie. No gorilla protection. You can't play 4k YouTube.
Build quality very pathetic.
"My honest opinion is ""This phone is amazing for the price I paid."" yes there are other phones out there in similar or higher specs for the same price range but the sAMOLED screen with 1080p resolution is no match. Plus the software is super smooth in the last two days of usage, I found no lag or slowness. I bought this during the sale and installed all the apps that I use regularly. Played these games without any trouble or lag, like PUBG and Call of duty, which is another big plus."
"Obviously there are some downsides, camera is not great and it auto glorifies the photo in a non realistic way but I believe it can be turned off or may be updated by software upgrades. The phone is a little heavy but I know this when I bought it as it has 6000mah batteries (what should I expect?)."
Anyways there are loads of positive things than couple of negatives which I am happy to accept (remember I spent ~11700). Nevertheless this is an over 5 star phone for the price.
Pros:
sAMOLED screen with 1080p - 5+⭐
11nm super fast speedy processor - 5+⭐
Samsung one UI software - 4.5 ⭐
Fast charging with 15w - 4.5 ⭐
Lightweight with 6000mAh battery - 4.5 ⭐
Finger print reading and location - 4⭐
Price of the phone - 5⭐
Cons:
"Camera quality (does not look like 48MP, more like 12MP & upscaled) - 3 ⭐"
Camera app or software - 3 ⭐
Monster battery lasts 1 day only (maybe a little over) with regular usage - 3⭐
Is it gorilla glass? Maybe not - 3.5⭐
Got damaged product  and return policy is not all good
Pls don't buy it
Camera is not up to the mark
And speed is also less
Really good phone. Great product from Samsung.
"Very bad camera not worty of calling itself a 48 megapixel camera,worst picture quality in night mode. It is a cheating with innocent customers. Highly recommend to avoid such prodect do not even deserve a single star rating."
I was having very much expectation on camera as this product comes with 45MP. After I captured some photo it came like a normal mobile photos and very average in terms photos.
Please do keep in mind and don't see it's 45MP
Good deal. Excellent power backup. Worth for money.
Everything Is Just Wow..Specialy Battery Backup and camera.. Look wise.. lit as Fire.. Thanku Amazon.. for delievering such a Good product and Verh fast Dlvry service.
Extremely disappointed in the camera.  Doesn't meet expectations. Primary or selfie camera took photos like 5mp. M30s not meet the basic requirements of camera  expectations. 48 mp is just for namesake
"Other stuff  battery, screen and speed are looks good"
"Camera is not worth , only pixel number is high not the photo quality specially  the front camera quality."
Battery is good nothing else.
Hanging after 2 days use
"Weak network showing  , at the same place and location other mobile signal is full with same service provider."
Completely junk
"Mind blowing which the Samsung is offering an affordable smartphone with the high specifications who will tell no ,,, come on."
6000mah battery and the new exynos 9611 with a game booster too.
Thanks for that Samsung
Received Prime order within 21hours. Attached photo's taken by my old Redmi 4 and M30s for comparison. Value for money👍👌.
It has written on box that Indian sim card only.... Its a gift for my husband who lives in foreign what to do plsss help
Screen quality not that good.
Camera not good.  48 mp is just for name.
I think late charging and comparing to mi 4000mah batery samsung 6000mah is vry bad
Like:
1. My battery lasts at 40-48 hours without even activating any power saving mode.
2. The camera is absolutely brilliant... the live focus and wide lens captures the miracle.
"3. The RAM never stops you from multitasking,  neither does the processor."
4. The camera doesn't pop out of the back panel. So you can easily keep your phone on a plane surface and use.
Dislike:
"1. My iPhone used to keep the audio either in earphones or phone depending on from where you receive the call. But, samsung puts it in audio accessories by default.. which makes you switch every time you receive a call while listening to music."
"1. Camera quality is very low, no matter which camera mode you are using, every picture is like clicked by 8MP camera"
"2. Mobile heating problem - while watching videos, while charging and at the time of the call"
"3. They don't have return policy, even if you raise request they will do some tests remotely and will tell you that this mobile don't have any issue"
Please not to buy due to following major reason which was i have practically observed...
"1. Both camera is too bad , like 5 MP picture."
2. lack of many features which provides by other smartphone company.
3. Network issue.
4. touch not upto the mark
"Main issue is camera quality, i will suggest not buy this phone"
if want to buy a good camera phone then dont go for it.very bad camera quality 48 mp camera only in the paper but in reality its only 8mp.
Awesome phone very nice
Display 5/5
Battery 5/5
Charging 5/5 very fast
Sound 5/5
Camera 5/5
Only thing to concern samsung pay & secure folder
"Battery  doesn't  perform  as it claims, it drains very fast.its like 3000mah battery"
1. Battery is getting drain very fast after its reaching 50% Mark. (Unlink 6000 MAH battery should perform).
2. Camera is Okay but not like 48 MP.
"3. I am facing internet connectivity issue, Downloading speed is okay but Uploading speed is worst, when i used another device at Same time and same Network, the performance was far better than this pathetic Phone."
"4. The phone does not come this any screen protection (for example Gorilla Glass etc), so you need to handle with care."
"5.Phone is heavy in weight (what i feel), as weight distribution is not properly done."
Want to say that every one is complaining about the camera ....
i want to clear them when u r taking a pic first u have to change the setting in to 48 mp.
After that u have to tauch the screen for better focusing... then u will see the dslr.
I unloaded some pic which are clicked by 48mp.. which are 22 mp and some are bigger than it.
yes i agree that the selfi camera should be more consistent.....
But make sure u are clicking the pic in proper natural lighting conditions...
then u will see the change.
other wise the camera normally takes 12 mp photo.
other features are awesome
specially battery and the screen
ram manage ment..
sore are complaining about the avaible ram
is just 1.2
Let me clear that i aslo get surprised to see 1.3 avaible ram
But after that installed 5o more application ..
"out of which some are larger and some are smaller in size like tiktok, insta,face book..."
but still surprisingly still 1.2 gb was available in ram...
So don't worry about that...
Just go for this mobile..
Go#monster......
 And feed in ur mind that sar value... also matter....... which we found muchlesser than any device....
 Very excited!!! Extremely happy
"Really good phone after a long gap from samsung., worth for money"
"It’s includes only charger head and cable, sim removal kit."
And disappoints
"There’s no headset, case covers and glass protector"
Battery is not so much good
As company says 6000mAh
Back case is not fit the phone
"Camera Quality is fine, its not upto mark as compare to real 48MP camera but at this price it's a valuable device. rest is ok, especially new Samsung UI is fantastic as compared to previous UI."
Everything in Short...
"Only Battery, Display and Processor is improved nothing else, so don't expect much from this..."
Display is superAMOLED
Immersive Experience from display...
Graphic Quality is much better in sAMOLED then IPS LED or TFT..
Battery is 6000mAh
Normal Use 2Days Backup
"Pubg 7hr, COD 9hr, Freefire 9hr"
Processor Exynos 9611
"Not Powerful than 710 or 712 but good enough for playing Games, not good for High end games..."
Camera
Just Bez of camera I deducted 1star...
"Not good at all, unsatisfied with camera.."
so my opinion....
Overall good phone but Z1x is better choice...
Awesome camera
Its camera
Contains spammy app named ironsource appcloud which pushes pesky ads on your phone. Very bad experience.
"Amazing display but there's not 48mp, it's look likes below 8mp"
Everything is amazing at this price range.
First Of all Thanks To Samsung India For Competing with Other Chinese Brands
"Ordered This Monster Yesterday And Got It Today... Such A Nice Opal Black Colour, It looks So Satisfying."
It was a Jaw Dropping Deal For me
It Has Got 6000 Mah Battery..So just Go for it blindly.
"It has Got 6.4"" sAmoled FHD+ Display which is just amazing at this price range"
IT has got Type C Fast Charging And A Dedicated Sim Slot..
I would have been Even more happier if it had a Gorilla Glass and A Metal/Glass Back.
The Processor is just Marvellous and The Camera Is Also Acceptable at this Price Point..
Thought of buying Realme XT/5 Pro
But reverted myself because of this Battery Specification...
"At Last Just Go For it Blindly Without thinking of Any Other Phone Brands, Because No one Will Provide such a Amazing Stuff At this Price Point.."
I Checked On 12 October This Phone Comes with a Exynos 9610 Processor...Shame on Samsung for this Fake Description
Awesome mobile go for it..
I personally loved it. System UI is best. And samsung display is best as usual. You can play games at high graphics. I played pubg mobile on HD graphics there was not a little lag till now.
Camera is just pretty Awesome.
Battery - it takes little more time to charge but it lasts long as well. I charged full once and its second day it's still 70.
Of course one can't compare this phone with same specification of S series because their price is high as well.
Just there was one thing I didn't like that's I installed my all needed apps around 14 including games and it shows only 1 GB memory available out of 4.
Best in this price from Samsung.
"I got it in 11,699 /-"
Value for money
"Nice phone to start with. Battery backup is really great. Phone looks good, performance not bad for a 6gb RAM variant. Amazon delivery improved a lot, last year same time during big sale, ordered a Vivo Y83 Plus which got delivered after 10 days instead of 48 hrs. This time, it was delivered on time."
"As i order this phone from amazon,"
"I received a damaged phone,"
"Phone body quality is good , but the phone is heating vehmently,"
"No mobile case were provided in mobile box,"
"Thats a reaaon i had given a return request to amazon,"
"My total experience with samsung M30s, its worst experience,"
"All companies phone are providing lots of features in the phone,"
"But the samsung m30s not giving a inbuild musicplayer application,"
"Or many others application also, like calculator , calender,"
"Power point, excell"
A m30s phone has a gik.......like a very good battery and very light weight as featured 6000mah battery! camera performance good not excellent all are good!nice design
"Amazon prime awesome, I received the m30s is just in less than 15 hours."
Awesome mobile phone........
"Worst camera ,over noises, no return policy,48 mp not only 8mp , I'm disappointed .mi brand is good mi a3 supper camera"
Average phone.
Battery life is good. It lasts all day even after heavy usage.
Fingerprint reader is good but it should be better in this price range.
Camera quality is below average. 48 MP feels like 8 MP photos.
"The  phone camera is shown 48 mp, where as its picture clarity is like 5 to 8  mpxl. I have requested for return, but Amazon is not accepting. Amazon is cheating with customers...friends please don't buy"
Very must dissappointed with this mbl.
"Please dont buy it, you will get disappointed asu dont have return option"
"Coming to camera ,48 mp is just number it is worse than 8 mp."
Battery is also not that great
Touch response is very slow
Facing network issue
Finger sensor is also slow
Very delicate..should handle carefully
Amazon and samsung are just playing cheap marketing strategy saying 48mp and 6000mah...it is equal to 8mp and 3500 mah..
Go for redmi note 7 pro..
I bought this phone on sept 28th and recieved it on 29th morning.After spending sometime with the device following are my observations:
PROS:
1.The Super Amoled full HD+ display is super bright and has rich colors.Best in this price segment.The display is protected by dragon tail glass and not gorilla glass.Dragon tail is durable and provides enough protection against scratches and drops from small hieghts.Its better to put on a tempered glass for additional safety.
2.The audio output via headphone jack/bluetooth is top notch.This device has Dolby Atmos support using headphones only.
3.The Mammoth 6000mah battery is a true power house.The device can easily last 2days with moderate to heavy usage.
"4.Although the 48mp main camera is a samsung sensor instead of sony,samsung has done fantastic software optimizations to capture stunning shots.The camera is one of the best in its segment.The super steady video mode which is found in flagship phones is included with this device and works brilliantly."
5.Samsung one UI OS is extremely stable.Fast response and fluid animations.Comes with android pie out of the box.The ram management is excellent better than its competition.
6.15 Watt fast charger included in the box.The device takes around 2hours 30 mins for a full charge from 0 to 100%.It seems a bit slow but considering the battery capacity it is decent.
7.Mobile comes with triple slot.You can install 2 sims and a micro SD card simultaneously.
CONS:
1.The back cover and finger print scanner are made of polycarbonate plastic and are prone to scratches with everyday use.
2.The speaker output is very low and sound quality is average.It is a mono speaker.
3.Physical Notification LED light is not present.It has Always on display feature for notifications.
4.The mobile doesnt come with any preapplied screen protector or case with in the box.Better order them along with the mobile.
5.Front camera performance is average even though it is 16MP resolution.
6. The gaming performance is decent.Althought with extended gaming for 15-20 mins the device heats up to 42-43°C while playing heavy games like PuBG in high settings.Changing the graphics to medium settings reduces the temperature by 4-5°C.
Verdict:
"All in all it is a surprise to see samsung targeting the budget segment aggressively.Considering the Specs and the price this is a must buy device for people looking for a bigger battery,media consumption,casual gaming and normal photography."
Phone is Ok but both Camera quality is very bad. It's like 5 MP camera. Want to return my set after use 12 hours. But Amazon refused. They check the phone online app system and say set is ok. So I sellout my set after use of 18 hours very low price.
Cheap product
Camera and build quality is worst.
Useless to buy at 11K+. We will definitely think twice to buy for
10K if we see display piece at store.
Only good thing is battery backup
A great product.  Everything is perfect.  Worth the price
"I ordered this phone on 28th September since I am a prime member. I recieved it on 29th Morning at 9:30 AM. After setting it up and installing the sim, the error comes, ""Sim 1 Not Allowed"" and ""Sim 2 Not Allowed""  Basically, long story short, no phone calls, texts, or connection to the network services can be made. Amazon technician cannot identify the issue. Samsung Customer Care says this issue only happens when the phone has been ""Reported Stolen"" and hence the IMEI number has been blocked. Quite shocking for a brand new phone and model which was launched on the 28th of September 2019."
"Amazon says ""NO REFUNDS"" and so I am stuck till they send a technician to figure it out. I would say wait for more reviews before you buy it. ALL THE BEST."
Vodafone SIM are not working with this phone. Weird problem but both Samsung and Vodafone need to work together to resolve the issue.
"Great deal, amazing sAMOLED screen, great speed, monster battery, camera is also good enough for the price you are paying. Only downside is - no headphone included in the box. So far so good. Bought it for my father and he is happy :) what more do you need."
"The Samsung Galaxy M30s is a fantastic flagship to the Galaxy M series. It is priced well and offers some really good features including a Super AMOLED display and a 5000 mAh battery ,& super 48 megapixel Camera."
Value for Money.
"Superb  Camera, Battery  life."
"Samsung Galaxy M30 is a compelling device, and if you are considering buying it, the decision of buying it will be a good one."
Samsung best phone
"Just metal body is missing, Camera qualify not outstanding, but good. Crazy battery life"
Very bad performance
Not working properly
Battery backup not good
Apps automatically closing within few seconds
Poor camera quality
No options to product return
Amazon service very bad
Don't waste money
Oppo 100times better
